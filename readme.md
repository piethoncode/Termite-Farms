## Credits
- Code for the actual site mostly by [user.exe](http://userexe.me) ([mrhappyma](http://github.com/mrhappyma))
  - I *might* have taken a little bit from stack overflow...
  - And it looks like I have barely contibuted on the graph because [techyporcupine](https://github.com/techyporcupine) took my code from my fork and added before i was done üò†
- Idea mostly from [piethoncode](https://github.com/piethoncode/). It's also his domain.
  - Well actually we got the domain for free from the github for education program thing.
- [techyporcupine](https://github.com/techyporcupine) I'm pretty sure he also was the one to write to email to [barak](https://www.youtube.com/c/CRACKLEgames).
